This flowchart outlines the main steps in the MCA application processing system:

1. Email Reception: The process begins when an email is received at submissions@dollarfunding.com.

2. Email Processing: The Email Processing Module extracts metadata and checks for attachments.

3. Document Classification: If attachments are present, they are classified (ISO application, bank statements, etc.).

4. OCR and Data Extraction: The advanced OCR solution extracts data from the classified documents.

5. Data Storage: Successfully extracted data is stored in the database (Google Cloud Firestore).

6. Application Status Update: The system updates the application status based on the extraction results.

7. Manual Review: If required (e.g., missing information), staff is notified to review the application.

8. Webhook Notification: Once processing is complete, a webhook notification is sent to the client.

9. Client Interaction: The client can view application details through the React and Tailwind CSS-based UI dashboard.

10. Further Actions: If needed, the client can take actions or update the application using the RESTful API.

This process ensures efficient handling of MCA applications, from initial receipt to client notification, with provisions for manual intervention when necessary. The system leverages Python for backend processes and TypeScript, React, and Tailwind CSS for the user interface, as specified in the project requirements.

   - Implementation: Google Cloud Identity Platform

7. Logging and Monitoring Interface
   - Protocol: REST API
   - Purpose: To send logs and metrics for system monitoring
   - Implementation: Google Cloud Logging and Monitoring APIs

### COMMUNICATION INTERFACES

The MCA application processing system will utilize the following communication interfaces:

1. RESTful API
   - Protocol: HTTPS
   - Data Format: JSON
   - Purpose: To provide programmatic access to application data and system functions
   - Key Endpoints:
     - /api/applications: CRUD operations for applications
     - /api/webhooks: Manage webhook subscriptions
     - /api/users: User management operations
     - /api/system: System status and configuration

2. Webhook Notifications
   - Protocol: HTTPS
   - Data Format: JSON
   - Purpose: To send real-time updates to client systems
   - Payload Structure:
     ```json
     {
       "event_type": "application_status_change",
       "application_id": "12345",
       "new_status": "ready",
       "timestamp": "2023-07-01T12:00:00Z"
     }
     ```

3. Email Communication
   - Protocol: SMTP (for sending notifications)
   - Purpose: To send system notifications and alerts to administrators
   - Implementation: Python's smtplib library

4. Internal Service Communication
   - Protocol: gRPC
   - Purpose: For efficient communication between internal microservices
   - Implementation: gRPC Python library

5. Database Communication
   - Protocol: Google Cloud Firestore Client Protocol
   - Purpose: To interact with the Firestore database for data storage and retrieval
   - Implementation: Google Cloud Firestore Client Library for Python

6. Cloud Storage Communication
   - Protocol: Google Cloud Storage API
   - Purpose: To store and retrieve large files and attachments
   - Implementation: Google Cloud Storage Client Library for Python

All communication interfaces will implement the following security measures:
- TLS 1.3 encryption for data in transit
- API key or OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication for all requests
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks

These communication interfaces provide a comprehensive and secure foundation for the MCA application processing system, enabling seamless integration with client systems and efficient internal operations.
