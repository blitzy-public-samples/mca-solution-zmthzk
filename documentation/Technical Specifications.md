    Merchants ||--o{ BankStatements : has
    Webhooks ||--o{ Applications : notifies

    Applications {
        string id PK
        string status
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }

    Attachments {
        string id PK
        string application_id FK
        string type
        string file_path
        timestamp uploaded_at
    }

    Merchants {
        string id PK
        string application_id FK
        string legal_name
        string dba_name
        string federal_tax_id
        string address
        string industry
        number annual_revenue
    }

    Owners {
        string id PK
        string application_id FK
        string name
        string ssn
        string address
        date date_of_birth
        number ownership_percentage
    }

    FundingDetails {
        string id PK
        string application_id FK
        number amount_requested
        string use_of_funds
    }

    EmailMetadata {
        string id PK
        string application_id FK
        string sender
        string subject
        string body
        timestamp received_at
    }

    BankStatements {
        string id PK
        string merchant_id FK
        date statement_date
        number closing_balance
    }

    Webhooks {
        string id PK
        string client_id
        string url
        string secret
        boolean active
    }
```

Indexing Strategy:
